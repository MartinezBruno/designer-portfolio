## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Vertical MVP mode. i18n plumbing, motion gate, and lifecycle registry land in Phase 1 (cheap early, expensive to retrofit).
- [Roadmap]: Stack per research: Astro 7.4, TypeScript ~6.0.3 (not 7.x), Tailwind 4.3 via `@tailwindcss/vite`, Node >= 24.16 (local 24.15 needs upgrade). [Proposed]
- [Roadmap]: Behance via a committed snapshot plus local overrides. The build never fetches Behance. [Proposed]
- [Roadmap]: Contact (Phase 5) depends only on Phase 2 and can run in parallel with Phases 3–4.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: Martina's explicit consent (DATA-01) is required before the Behance sync script is built.
- Phase 3: Project count unresolved (7 vs 14). It decides whether PROJ-04..07 (filters/search) apply in Phase 4.
- Phase 7: Page-transition approach open (`<ClientRouter />` vs native cross-document view transitions).
- Phases 3, 5, 7 flagged for deeper research before planning.
- Open questions for Martina: availability badge, brand fonts, custom domain, testimonials (v2).
